1. Documentations on Requirements analysis (By 06.01 11:59 PM)
2. Finish Main Screen GUI (By 05.30 11:59 PM)  

Project end time: 08/23

Requirements  
1. You must have a graphical user interface for the user to select a game to play. (As a user I want to select a game to play using a graphical user interface so that I can improve my game playing skills.)
2. You must implement three games, including game logic, from at least two of the following categories:
- Card Games (solitaire or multiplayer)
- Board Game (checkers, battleship, etc)
- Logic Games (crossword, wordle, brain teasers)
3. You must provide the user with a way to end the game and return to the game selection screen.
4. You must provide the user with a way to exit the Game Suite application from within the GUI of the application.
5. You must include help text for each game including instructions/rules for game play.
6. You must apply good object-oriented design principles. This includes, at a minimum, encapsulating functionality and leveraging hierarchies to reuse common functionality instead of copy and pasting multiple places.
7. You do not have to implement networking for multiplayer games.
8. You must utilize iterative development to analyze, design, and implement your application.
9. You may use a game logic engine for one of your games. This is for the logic and rules of game play not the game GUI itself.
